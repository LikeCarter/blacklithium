Inconsistent numbers are being reported by health officials at the centre of the outbreak. On February 11, the number of new confirmed cases slowed and the Dow closed at a [record](https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stocks-rise-as-optimism-prevails-11581503200). But only a day later, health officials in Hubei province confirmed 14,840 new infections. The total number of confirmed cases in Hubei Province is now 48,206. In response, the CCP [ousted](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-ousts-top-official-in-coronavirus-outbreaks-epicenter-11581568911) the party secretaries of Hubei province and Wuhan.

So what is really happening?

## Conclusion


The sudden jump in Coronavirus cases is likely the result of inadequate testing. The original nucleic acid tests are only 30-40% accurate. Moreover, there is a shortage of testing kits and **the results of this testing kit takes two days**. Many infected patients were told to go home rather than be isolated and undergo treatment. The deceased whistle-blower [Dr. Li Wenliang](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/world/asia/china-coronavirus-doctor-death.html) needed to be tested five times before the test showed a positive result.

This leads to delayed treatment and increases the chances of spreading the virus. Leading to an increased Ro value. Scientists have reported that the Coronavirus has a transmission rate (Ro) of 1.5-3.0 without effective containment measures.
