## Sharpe Ratio

Named after William F. Sharpe, who developed it in 1966 (revised in 1994), the Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure of return that uses standard deviation to represent risk. The Sharpe ratio is simply the return per unit of risk (represented by variance).  The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the combined performance of "risk" and return.

Using an annualized Sharpe Ratio is useful for comparison of multiple return streams.  The annualized Sharpe ratio is computed by dividing the annualized mean monthly excess return by the annualized monthly standard deviation of excess return. Like any other mathematical model, it relies on the data being correct. For example, Ponzi schemes have high Sharpe ratios.

This function annualizes the number based on the scale parameter.

William Sharpe now recommends _Information Ratio_ preferentially to the original Sharpe Ratio.



## Information Ratio

The information ratio is similar to the Sharpe ratio, the main difference being that the Sharpe ratio uses a risk-free return as benchmark whereas the information ratio uses a risky index as benchmark (such as the S&P500).



## Additional Information

Berkshire Hathaway had a Sharpe ratio of 0.76 for the period 1976 to 2011, higher than any other stock or mutual fund with a history of more than 30 years. The stock market had a Sharpe ratio of 0.39 for the same period.

Quantiative hedge funds and high-frequency trading firms often boast much higher Sharpe ratios. It was recently unveiled that Renaissance Technologies' Medallion Fund has a Sharpe ratio that has never been below 2.0, and as high as 7.0 As possibly the most successful quantitative hedge fund in history, Renaissance’s Medallion fund, available only to the firm’s employees, has reportedly generated returns of almost 80% a year (before fees) since being founded in 1988 by James Simmons.
