Your privacy is critically important to me. I have a few fundamental principles:

*   I am thoughtful about the personal information I ask you to provide and the personal information that I collect about you through the operation of my services.
*   I store personal information for only as long as I have a reason to keep it.
*   I aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on my website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.
*   I help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.
*   I aim for full transparency on how I gather, use, and share your personal information.

Below is my Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.

### Who I am and What This Policy Covers

Throughout this Privacy Policy I'll refer to my websites, mobile applications, and other products and services collectively as “Services.” Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of my products or services that have a separate privacy policy. Below I explain how I collect, use, and sham information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.

### Creative Commons Sharealike License

I've decided to make this Privacy Policy available under a [Creative Commons Sharealike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. The original copy of this privacy policy is curtosy of Automattic from [Github](https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic). You’re more than welcome to copy it, adapt it, and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your policy reflects your actual practices.

### Information I Collect

I only collect information about you if I have a reason to do so–for example, to provide my Services, to communicate with you, or to make my Services better. I collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to me, automatically through operating my Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that I collect.

#### _Information You Provide_

It’s probably no surprise that I collect information that you provide to me. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how I use the information. Here am some examples:

*   **Basic Account Information:** I ask for basic information from you in order to set up an account such as an email address, name, and password.
*   **Billing and Contact Information:** If you buy something from me, you will provide additional personal and payment information, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.
*   **Communications with me (Hi There!):** When you communicate with me via form, email, phone, or otherwise, I store a copy of my communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law). 

#### _Information I Collect Automatically_

I also collect some information automatically:

*   **Log Information:** Like most online service providers, I collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. I collect log information when you use my Services–for example, when you create or make changes to your Service.
*   **Usage Information:** I collect information about your usage of my Services. For example, I collect information about the actions that users perform–in other words, who did what, when and to what thing along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). I use this information to, for example, provide my Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use my Services, so I can make my Services better.


### How and Why I Use Information

#### _Purposes for Using Information_

I use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:

*   To provide my Services–for example, to set up and maintain your account, host your service, charge you for any of my paid Services,;
*   To further develop and improve my Services–for example by adding new features that I think my users will enjoy or will help them;
*   To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with my Services, which helps me improve my Services and make them easier to use;
*   To communicate with you. For example, I may email you to solicit your feedback, sham tips for getting the most out of my products, text you to verify your payment, or call you to sham offers and promotions that I think will be of interest to you. If you don’t want to hear from me, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (Please keep in mind that even if you opt out, I'll still send you important updates relating to your account)

#### _Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information_

A note here for those in the European Union about my legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that my use of your information is based on the grounds that: (1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill my commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account--for example, in order to enable access to my website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or (2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or (4) I have a legitimate interest in using your information -- for example, to provide and update my Services; to improve my Services so that I can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard my Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of my advertising; to understand my user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with my Services; and to personalize your experience; or (5) You have given me your consent--for example before I place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, I may change the Privacy Policy from time to time. I encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.

That’s it! Thanks for reading.
